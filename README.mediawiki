=Disk Serve - Diskless Server Web Management=

==Usage==
Please see http://wiki.nakhon.net/wiki/Diskless_Server (Document is in Thai)

==License==
I did not find the right license yet. In mean time, the idea is as follow.

===Self usage===
You are free to install on your machine for either personal or commercial usage. This free license ends when you do not
own the machine or when you do not possess the machine. You must delete program when you sell, rent or give away the
machine.

===Install for others===
You have to obtain commercial license to install the program on machine not belong to you or the machine that you plan
to rent to others.
